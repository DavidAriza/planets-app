## Technical considerations

Clean Architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns by organizing the code into distinct layers: Presentation (UI & state management), Domain (business logic & use cases), and Data (repositories & data sources).

Riverpod is used to manage state because it is robust, typically requires less boilerplate, making it easier to implement and maintain, Riverpod also allow us to inject our dependencies so we don't need and extra package for that (I usually use get_it with other state management solutions).

Hive serves as a local database solution for storing favorite planets. It is fast, lightweight, and non-relational, making it perfect for our use case.

dartz package for better error handling â€“ Either<Failure, Success> helps return failures or results instead of just throwing exceptions.

go router is a powerful routing package that simplifies navigation
